This project began with our thesis project, a system for the organization and distribution of the calendar for the University of Havana.

It mainly implements the specifications given in the protocols: RFC 4791 (CalDAV) and RFC 5545 (iCalendar), also partially implements other related calendar protocols.

The system is multiplataform, since it's implemented with the latest Microsoft's web technology, Asp.net Core for the server side.

In the near future, we are going to start or continue with the implementations of other calendar protocols, secure the HTTP communications, OAUTH authentication and much more. For the client side we're going to design and implement the UI for the users and the UI for the administration of the server.

We are accepting contributions to the project, no matter how small.
